## Existing Problems
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) offers a historical grade distribution visualization tool developed by Professor Ulmschneider, which enables students to analyze past GPA trends across various courses. While this tool aids students in making informed decisions about course selection, it remains limited by its retrospective view, focusing only on past data. This raises an intriguing question: **Could historical data be leveraged to predict future GPA and grade distributions for UIUC courses?**

Such predictions could offer valuable insights for a range of stakeholders within the academic environment:
- **Administrative and hiring committees**: A predictive model could inform faculty hiring decisions by highlighting departments or courses in need of additional teaching resources or structural adjustments.
- **Faculty and course designers**: Predicted GPA distributions could help assess whether planned course structures align with teaching goals, enabling adjustments to enhance learning outcomes.
- **Students**: The model could serve as a proactive guide for academic planning, helping students identify courses that align with their academic goals or avoid those with consistently lower grade trends to optimize their GPA.

By developing a **deep learning model** to analyze and predict GPA trends, we could move beyond traditional visualization tools and instead provide a data-driven approach to academic planning at UIUC. This model would take into account diverse influencing factors, such as:
- Instructor history
- Course content updates
- Student demographics

This forward-looking analysis of grade distributions would foster an adaptable and transparent academic environment, empowering UIUCâ€™s students and faculty with actionable insights for more strategic academic planning.
