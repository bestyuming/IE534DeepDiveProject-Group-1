Existing Problems
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) offers a historical grade distribution visualization tool developed by Professor Ulmschneider, which enables students to analyze past GPA trends across various courses. While this tool aids students in making informed decisions about course selection, it remains limited by its retrospective view, focusing only on past data. This raises an intriguing question: could historical data be leveraged to predict future GPA and grade distributions for UIUC courses?
Such predictions could offer valuable insights for a range of stakeholders within the academic environment. For administrative and hiring committees, a predictive model could inform faculty hiring decisions by highlighting departments or courses in need of additional teaching resources or structural adjustments. Faculty and course designers, too, could utilize predicted GPA distributions to assess whether their planned course structures align with their teaching goals, potentially making adjustments to enhance learning outcomes. Additionally, students could use the model as a proactive guide in planning their academic paths, identifying courses that align with their academic goals or avoiding those with consistently lower grade trends to optimize their GPA.
By developing a deep learning model to analyze and predict GPA trends, we could move beyond traditional visualization tools and instead provide a data-driven approach to academic planning at UIUC. This model would take into account diverse influencing factors, such as instructor history, course content updates, and student demographics, to deliver a more nuanced and forward-looking analysis of grade distributions. This approach would foster an adaptable and transparent academic environment, empowering UIUC’s students and faculty with actionable insights for more strategic academic planning.
